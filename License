Gaode Map License
Subject to the Terms, AutoNavi hereby grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the Amap API and the services provided by the Amap API on the website or APP developed and/or operated by you in the manner permitted by the Terms.
The Amap API is free of charge for the websites and applications serving the public, provided that the map service module provided to the users by the APP developed and/or operated by you shall also be free of charge, and the services provided to the users by the APP developed and/or operated by you shall be available to the public generally. If your APP does not meet the requirement stated above or you use the Service for any commercial purpose, such as for providing paid map service, and make a profit therefrom directly or indirectly, you need to enter into a written agreement with AutoNavi separately or obtain AutoNavi’s prior written consent.
You may only use the API functions listed and available on the Amap API file to display the results     of related service data of the Amap API, and may not directly access or use any internal data, pictures, programs or modules or any other services or functions of the Amap API. Subject to the Terms, you may, while providing users with other information, use the Amap API to obtain related service data of the API.
Prior to the use of the Service by the website or APP developed and/or operated by you, AutoNavi is entitled to examine your website or APP, and request you to provide relevant evidentiary materials and agree to the additional terms, and has the right to decide whether or not to permit you to use the Service in its sole discretion. AutoNavi is entitled to unilaterally reject any application for use of the Service for any reason, without any liability for any damage of any kind that may be suffered by you due to such rejection. After the launch of the Service on your website or APP, AutoNavi shall still be entitled to examine your website or APP according to the Terms and request you to provide additional evidentiary materials or impose appropriate restrictions on your website or APP depending on the actual situations.
After a website or APP passes AutoNavi’s examination, AutoNavi is entitled to, in its sole discretion, decide on the specific service platforms, including AutoNavi’s existing service platforms and new service platforms that AutoNavi may develop or acquire in the future, accessibleto the website or APP.
AutoNavi is entitled to limit the number of requests for the Service and data volume of the Service. Please refer to the Website for the specific limits. Generally, AutoNavi will not limit the number of requests for the Service made by and the data volume of the Service used by a website or APP each day. However, if your APP requests the Service continuously, causing excessive pressure on the load of AutoNavi’s server or other resources, or the limit on use being exceeded, or otherwise use the Service abnormally, AutoNavi is entitled to, according to its own judgment, limit your APP’s number of requests and data volume, or suspend or terminate the provision of the Service to you. If you wish to remove such limit on use, you shall contact and get written consent from AutoNavi.
All other rights not explicitly granted herein still belong to AutoNavi. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as impliedly or otherwise granting any other rights not provided herein to you. To obtain other rights, you shall enter into a written agreement with AutoNavi separately or obtain AutoNavi’s prior written consent.
